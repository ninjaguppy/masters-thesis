\chapter*{Abstract}
A newcomer the greater story of mathematics, free analysis seeks to understand
functions that accept matrices of arbitrary sizes as inputs. Despite the fact
that these functions are naturally noncommutative, many classical results from
the study of complex variables and real algebraic geometry have direct analogues
in this new setting. Unfortunately, the topological underpinnings are shaky at
best. In this thesis we cover recent efforts to address these issues---including
the first developments of an theory of algebraic topology of matrix domains.
