\section{Matrix Universes}%
\label{sec:MatUniv}

Beyond the functional calculus, it becomes useful to construct general functions
on spaces of matrices---to do so, we must make this idea of ``spaces of
matrices'' concrete. The largest such space is the so-called \textbf{Matrix
  Universe}---consisting of \(g\)-tuples of matrices of all sizes:
\[
  \MM^g = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty (M_n(\CC))^g
\]
By convention, when we consider some
\(X = \left( X_1, \dots , X_g \right) \in \MM^g\), we require that the \(X_i\)
are all the same size. Since \(\MM^g\) is such a large set, we often want to
deal with subsets that still carry some of the implicit structure of \(\MM^g\).
\begin{definition}[Free Set]
  \label{def:FreeSet}
  We say \(D \subset \MM^g\) is a \textbf{free set} if it is closed with respect
  to direct sums and unitary conjugation. That it
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \(X,Y \in D \) means \(X\oplus Y \in D\).
    \item For \(X,U\) like-size matrices with \(U\) unitary and \(X \in D\),
          then \(U X U^* = \left( UX_1U^*, \dots , UX_g U^*  \right) \in D \).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

For the remainder of this text, \(D\) will denote some free set. Using the
terminology of \cite{pascoeFreeNoncommutativePrincipal2020}, let
\(D_n = D \cap M_n(\CC)^g\) be the level-wise slice of all \(n \times n\)
matrices in \(D\). We say that \(D\) is \textbf{open}\footnote{The topology of \(\MM^g\)
  is still in flux and there is not a canonical topology. See section NUMBER for
  the details } (resp.\ \textbf{connected}, \textbf{simply connected}) if each \(D_n\) is open
(resp.\ connected, simply connected). Finally, we say that \(D\) is
\textbf{differentiable} if each \(D_n\) is an open \(C^1\) manifold where the
complex tangent space of every \(X \in D_n\) is all of \(M_n(\CC)^g\).

In the context of sections \ref{sec:functionalcalc} \ref{sec:ExtMuliVarFun} {\color{red} how to ref
  multiple sections}, the domains in the functional calculus were
\(\HH^g = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} {\HH_n}^g\). \(\HH ^g\) is a differentiable a
free set with two connected components.

On \(\MM^{g} \), we define a product that resembles the inner product on
\(\CC^n\). Given \(A,B \in \MM^{g} \) which are \(g\)-tuples of \(n \times n\)
matrices:
\begin{align*}
	\cdot : \MM^{g} \times \MM^{g}  &\longrightarrow M_n(\CC) \\
  \cdot (A,B) = A \cdot B &\longmapsto \sum_{i=1}^g A_i B_i
\end{align*}

{\color{red} James uses this product, but like what in the world is going on
  with it???}

\section{The Topology of Matrix Universes }%
\label{sec:TopManUniv}

{\color{blue} How much detail here? Just what we are doing or the basics of the
  other topologies? This could also talk about the nc varieties/singular sets}



\section{Tracial Functions and Uniqueness of the Gradient}%
\label{sec:TracGrad}
Now that we have \(\MM^d\), we can work with general functions on our matrix
universe. As a whole, free analysis is concerned with so-called \emph{free
  functions}, which respect the direct sums and unitary conjugation.
{\color{red} Do they need to be graded?}
\begin{definition}[Free Function]
\label{def:FreeFun}
  A function \(f: D\to \MM^{\color{red} \text{something}}\) is called \textbf{free} if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \(f(X\oplus Y)= f(X) \oplus f(Y)\)
    \item \(f(U X U^*) = f(U)f(X)f(U^*)\) where \(X\) and \(U\) are like-size
          and \(U\) is unitary.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The two other classes of functions we are concerned with are those that act like
the trace and the determinant:
\begin{definition}[Determinantal Free Function]
  \label{def:DetFreeFun}
  A function \(f: D \to \CC \) is a \textbf{determinantal free function} if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \(f(X\oplus Y) = f(X)f(Y)\)
    \item \(f(U X U^*) = f(X)\) where \(X\) and \(U\) are like-size
          and \(U\) is unitary.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Tracial Free Function]
  \label{def:TrFreeFun}
  A function \(f: D \to \CC \) is a \textbf{tracial free function} if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \(f(X\oplus Y) = f(X)+f(Y)\)
    \item \(f(U X U^*) = f(X)\) where \(X\) and \(U\) are like-size
          and \(U\) is unitary.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Given a free function of any type, we can define the directional derivative
(Definition \ref{def:DirDeriv}) identically. It is worth noting that, while they
share the moniker of \emph{free}, determinantal and tracial functions are
\emph{not} free functions.
It is only these tracial functions which inherit the gradient mentioned above.
Similarly to traditional multivariable calculus we define the gradient via its
relationship to the directional derivative:
\begin{definition}[Free Gradient]
\label{def:FreeGrad}
  Given a tracial free function \(f\), the free gradient, \(\nabla f\), is the
  unique free function satisfying
  \[
    \tr \left( H \cdot \nabla f(X) \right) = \tr\, Df(X)[H]
  \]
\end{definition}

It is not-at-all obvious that such a \(\nabla f \) should be unique---after all
any linear combination of commutator is has trace zero. {\color{red} should I
  explain this?} In the case that \(f\) is a single-variable function we can
replace \(\nabla f\) with the traditional derivative, \(f'\), as seen in
\cite[Thm 3.3]{pascoeTrace2020}.
\begin{theorem}
  Let \(f: (a,b)\to \RR \) be a \(C^1\) function. Then
  \[
    \tr \, Df(X)[H] = \tr \left( Hf'(X) \right)
  \]
\end{theorem}

The proof in \cite{pascoeTrace2020} simply asserts the uniqueness of a function
\(g(X)\) and then shows that \(g(x)=f'(x)\) for \(x \in (a,b)\). Instead, we can
construct such a \(g\) and recover the theorem along the way:
\begin{proof}

We start with a construction from Bhatia's Matrix Analysis: Let
$f \in C ^{1} (I)$ and define $f ^{[1]} $ on $I \times I$ by
\[
  f^{[1]} (\lambda,\mu) =
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{f(\lambda) - f(\mu)}{\lambda-\mu} & \lambda \neq \mu \\
    f'(\lambda) & \lambda = \mu.
  \end{cases}
\]
We call $f ^{[1]} (\lambda,\mu)$ the \emph{first divided difference} of $f$ at
$(\lambda,\mu)$. If $\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix with entries
$\{ \lambda_{i}\} $, We may extend $f$ to accept $\Lambda$ by
defining the $(i,j)$-entry of $f ^{[1]} (\Lambda)$ to be
$f ^{[1]} (\lambda_i,\lambda_j)$. If $A$ is a self adjoint matrix with
$A = U \Lambda U ^{*} $, then we define
$f ^{[1]} (A) = U f ^{[1]} (\Lambda) U ^{*} $. Now we borrow a theorem from
Bhatia \cite{bhatiaMatrixAnalysis1997}:
\begin{theorem}[Bhatia V.3.3]

{\color{red} Theorem numbering?}
  Let $f \in C ^{1} (I)$ and let $A$ be a self adjoint matrix with all
  eigenvalues in $I$. Then \[
    Df(A)[H] = f ^{[1]} (A) \circ H,
  \]
  where $\circ$ denotes the Schur-product\footnote{Entrywise} in a basis where $A$ is diagonal.
\end{theorem}

That is, if $A = U   \Lambda U ^{*} $, then
\[
  Df(A)[H] = U \left( f ^{[1]} (\Lambda) \circ (U ^{* } H U) \right)U ^{*}.
\]
%
To prove our claim, we need to take the trace of both sides. Since trace is
invariant under a change of basis, it is clear that
\[
  \tr Df(A)[H] = \tr \left( f ^{[1]} (\Lambda) \circ (U ^{* } H U) \right).
\]
If $U = u_{ij}$, $U ^{*} = \overline{u}_{ij}$ and $H = h_{ij}$, then the
$(i,j)$-entry of $U ^{*}HU$ is
\[
  {(U ^{* } H U)}_{ij} = \overline{u}_{ik}h_{k\ell}u_{\ell j}
\]
Where we sum over the duplicate indices $k$ and $\ell$. While the structure of
$f ^{[1]} (\Lambda)$ is a bit unruly, our diagonal entries are $f'(\lambda)$.
This means that when we take the trace of the Schur product, we have
\[
 \sum_k\sum_\ell \sum_i f'(\lambda_i)\overline{u}_{ik}h_{k\ell}u_{\ell i}
\]
Now consider the matrix product
$U\, \text{diag} \{f'(\lambda_1), \dots ,f'(\lambda_n)\} \,U ^{*} H $. Since one of our terms
is diagonal, the trace of this multiplication is simple:
\[
  \text{tr}\; U \,\text{diag} \{f'(\lambda_1), \dots ,f'(\lambda_n)\}\, U ^{*} H
  = \sum_k\sum_\ell\sum_i  u_{ik}f'(\lambda_k) \overline{u}_{k \ell} h_{\ell i}
\]
Since \(u_{ik}, \overline{u}_{k\ell}, h_{\ell i} \in \CC \) they commute. We can
then relabel our indices
$i \mapsto \ell\; \ell \mapsto k \; k \mapsto i $ to get
\[
  \tr\; U \,\text{diag} \{f'(\lambda_1), \dots ,f'(\lambda_n)\}\, U ^{*} H
  = \sum_k\sum_\ell \sum_i f'(\lambda_i) \overline{u}_{i k} h_{k \ell}u_{\ell i},
\]
So, for every direction \(H\), we have that
$\tr \left( U\, \text{diag} \{f'(\lambda_1), \dots ,f'(\lambda_n)\} \,U ^{*} H\right) =
   \tr \left( f ^{[1]} (\Lambda) \circ (U ^{* } H U) \right). $
{\color{red} overfull hbox :eyeroll:}
By picking the ``correct'' \(H\)\footnote{See example EXAMPLE NUMBER for
  details}, we conclude that our unique quantity \(g(X)\) is
\(U\, \text{diag} \{f'(\lambda_1), \dots ,f'(\lambda_n)\} \,U ^{*} \). But,
recall that \(X=U\Lambda U\) so, in the functional calculus, $g(X) = f'(X)$.
This recovers theorem 3.3 of \cite{pascoeTrace2020} as we have constructed a
\(g\) such that
\[
  \tr \; Df(X)[H] = \tr H g(X)
\]
\end{proof}
