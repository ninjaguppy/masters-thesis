# A Running Journal of Thesis Progress
Note: Any ''links'' in this file are broken if you are viewing on git. I promise
they work in emacs which is more useful for me. I will try to fix the another
time. 

## Dec 16

Filled in details of Trace Duality argument---reproving theorem 3.3 of Trace
Minimax along the way. Details in [Trace Duality](Trace Duality/M599TraceDuality.pdf)

Wrote the start of an argument for why we can work inside the trace.

## Dec 17 

Got distracted with configuring emacs... Then I fleshed out the argument of why
we can pull apart the trace. To my knowledge it works, but there is QQ in the
document. Copied here:


**QQ*:* Is this necessarily true? This is very nitpicky, but does the fact
that $f$ and $g$ have the same components mean they have the same expression? I
see how it would make the same function, but I see a potential issue with
domain---if they have different domains then they could have different
expressions but still have the same entries when the domains overlap.



**QQ:** What sort of voice should I be using when I am doing this writing? What
voice for the thesis? It seem inappropriate for it to read like a homework
exercise---where my goal is to show the reader that _I_ know what is going on.
